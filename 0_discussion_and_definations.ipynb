    "## Choosing a build backend\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools like **pip** and **build** do not actually convert your sources into a **distribution package** (like a **wheel**); that job is performed by a build backend. The **build backend** determines how your project will specify its configuration, including metadata (information about the project, for example, the name and tags that are displayed on PyPI) and input files. Build backends have different levels of functionality, such as whether they support building **extension modules**, and you should choose one that suits your needs and preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "The pyproject.toml tells **build frontend** tools like pip and build which backend to use for your project. Below are some examples for common build backends, but check your backend’s own documentation for more details.\n",
    "\n",
    "**pip**: The most popular tool for installing Python packages, and the one included with modern versions of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "**build**: A tool that helps prepare your Python project to be packaged, but it doesn’t actually make the final installable file itself — it asks the build backend to do that. Think of it like a helper that organizes everything before the “factory” makes the final product.\n",
    "\n",
    "**distribution package**: The ready-to-install version of your project that others can download and use. It’s like a box containing all the files, instructions, and info someone needs to install your software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**wheel**: A specific type of distribution package for Python. You can think of it as a pre-packed box that’s easy and fast to install — Python can just “unpack it” without extra work.\n",
    "\n",
    "**build backend**: The “factory” that actually creates the distribution package from your project. It reads your project’s settings, metadata, and code, and produces the final installable file. Different backends have different abilities depending on what kind of project you have.\n",
    "\n",
    "**extension module**: A piece of Python code that is written in another language, usually C or C++, to make it run faster or do things Python alone can’t. You can still use it like a regular Python module once it’s built.\n",
    "\n",
    "**build frontend**: A tool you use to tell the build backend to make your package. It doesn’t do the actual building itself — it’s more like a “project manager” that organizes the work and gives instructions to the backend (the “factory”). Example:\n",
    "\t•\tbuild is a frontend — you run python -m build, and it calls the backend (like Hatchling or Setuptools) to create the wheel or sdist.\n",
    "\t•\tpip can also act as a frontend when installing a package: it downloads the source and tells the backend to build it if needed.\n"

    "### How to choose a Python Build Backend\n",
    "\n",
    "When packaging Python projects, the **build backend** is the tool that takes your project code and metadata and produces a distribution package (wheel, sdist). Choosing the right backend depends on your project’s complexity, features, and workflow preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1️⃣ What a Build Backend Does\n",
    "- Reads your project metadata (e.g., `[project]` table in `pyproject.toml`)  \n",
    "- Builds a **distribution package** (wheel, sdist)  \n",
    "- Handles optional features like **extension modules** (C/C++ code), custom scripts, and dependency resolution  \n",

    "| Backend | Pros | Cons | Use Case |\n",
    "|---------|------|------|----------|\n",
    "| **Hatchling** | Modern, very fast, simple config, supports `[project]` metadata | Smaller ecosystem, fewer plugins than setuptools | Great for new projects with standard Python packages |\n",
    "| **Setuptools** | Very mature, flexible, huge ecosystem, lots of tutorials | Can be more verbose, older style configuration | Projects with C extensions, legacy code, or complex packaging needs |\n",
    "| **Flit** | Extremely simple, automatic metadata handling | Limited flexibility for complex builds | Small pure-Python libraries, beginner-friendly |\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Complexity / C extensions:**  \n",
    "   - If your project has **extension modules**, custom build steps, or legacy requirements, **Setuptools** is safer.  \n",

    "3. **Modern workflow:**  \n",
    "   - If you want **all-in-one tools** (dependencies + packaging), **PDM** is a good choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Community support & tutorials:**  \n",
    "   - **Setuptools** has the largest support.  \n",
    "   - **Hatchling** is simpler, modern, and fully compatible with `[project]` metadata.  \n",
